# Features-Bedrock
This is the Features-Bedrock add-on for Bedrock Minecraft system.

# Note
In the Scripting API @minecraft/vanilla-data modules, usage of the vanilla data and Microsoft's copyrights belong to them. I hold no control of such files, and they are for pure reference by my modules.

If you use Vibrant Visuals, this pack will not be compatible.

# Prequisites

You also need to enable Beta APIs for some features. If you don't, some features, like the Ore Regeneration module, will not be available. All modules required with the Beta APIs can be seen in the /scripts folder.

If you are on the Bedrock Console Editions, like Xbox, PlayStation or Nintendo Switch, you will require a Bedrock Server to run.
